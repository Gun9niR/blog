## Internship Experience

### Metabit Trading

  Data System Engineering Intern, Data Infra Team, Feb 2022 - Now

- Implemented a redis client that is around 5x faster than [redis-plus-plus](https://github.com/sewenew/redis-plus-plus) in our use cases by taking advantage of parallelism.
- Implemented the cache layer of the storage platform **MarketFS** based on a redis cluster, which improved the system throughput by 5x compared with the original filesystem-based cache and reduced the memory consumption by 4x.

## Projects

- [Basic](https://github.com/Gun9niR/Basic) -- An elementary interpreter with GUI
- [Jlox](https://github.com/Gun9niR/Crafting-Interpreters) -- A more serious interpreter with common programming language features
- [LSM](https://github.com/Gun9niR/LSM) -- LSM KV store
- [Ray tracer](https://github.com/Gun9niR/Ray-Tracer-in-Cpp) -- A basic ray tracer with antialiasing, defocus blur, motion blur, light source, importance sampling
- [Kilo](https://github.com/Gun9niR/Kilo) -- A minial text editor that runs on terminal
