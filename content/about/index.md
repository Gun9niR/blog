## What my ID means

You might be wondering what my ID means at first glance. Well, it's actually an alias for **Gungnir**, the weapon of Odin in Norse mythology. Legend goes that it never misses its target, which sounds very kick-ass to me. But in reality, I'm nothing like Gungnir: I never consider it the end of the world not to accomplish my predefined task. I just try my best, and be happy with whatever I get. It's my secret for keeping a healthy mindset, and recover from any setback.
